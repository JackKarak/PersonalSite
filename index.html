    <div class="experience-description">
        <p>This summer, I joined Khanjur Research & Development, a nimble startup founded by Sabrina Curtis—a trailblazing engineer and expert in Shape Memory Alloys. Khanjur focuses on cutting-edge applications of these materials in actuators, semiconductors, and sputtering technologies. As a small team tackling complex, high-stakes projects, the company embodies adaptability, innovation, and deep technical curiosity—making it the perfect environment to explore the business side of advanced materials.</p>

        <p>My role spanned strategy, pricing, and operations. I led the development of a comprehensive pricing system for an $800,000 proposal submitted to the Department of Defense, incorporating direct and indirect costs, sensitivity analyses, and breakeven modeling that supported a potential capital investment in new manufacturing machinery.</p>

        <p>Beyond financial modeling, I took charge of supplier outreach and vendor due diligence, compiling a side-by-side comparison of 10 companies based on pricing, capabilities, and inspection standards to inform sourcing decisions. I also delivered five strategic briefing reports to company leadership, offering actionable recommendations on market positioning, customer segmentation, and industry trends.</p>

        <p>This internship didn’t just deepen my technical and analytical skills—it taught me how to operate within the fast-moving, often ambiguous world of a startup, where business decisions are intertwined with specialized, technical products. I learned to simplify complexity, move quickly, and think holistically about growth.</p>

        <p>As Vice President of Chapter Operations for Delta Sigma Pi, I serve as the logistical and strategic backbone of our chapter—ensuring national reporting compliance, managing internal communications, and driving continuous improvement through the Chapter Management Program (CMP).</p>

        <p>To modernize our operations and reinforce the fraternity’s core pillars, I helped design and launch a point bucket system. This initiative encouraged members to stay balanced across areas like DEI, Health & Wellness, and Fundraising.</p>

        <p>To make the system seamless, I engineered a fully automated point-tracking solution in Excel using VBA and advanced formulas. Members could view real-time audits of their points across each bucket—a first for the chapter.</p>

        <p>Taking it a step further, I built a custom mobile app using React Native, TypeScript, and Expo, hosted on GitHub. The app centralizes our operations by syncing event forms directly to Google Calendar via API, logging attendance codes to a Supabase backend in real time, delivering event analytics for officers and admins, and providing easy access to our newsletter, point audit system, and test bank.</p>

        <p>This project has not only streamlined internal processes but also helped redefine what accountability and engagement look like in a professional fraternity.</p>
